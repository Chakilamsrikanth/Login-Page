**Interactive Login Page with Animated Elements**

This project features a visually engaging login page with interactive animations that dynamically respond to user input. The login form elements are adorned with animations that follow the movement of the mouse pointer, creating an immersive and playful user experience. One of the standout features of this login page is the animated eyes that track the mouse pointer's movement. Additionally, a clever interaction has been implemented: when the user begins typing their password, the eyes of the animated character close, adding a touch of whimsy to the login process.

**Technologies Utilized:**
This project primarily utilizes CSS to create captivating animations and styling for the login page. While HTML5 provides the structure for the page, CSS takes center stage in defining the visual elements and their behaviors. JavaScript is also employed to enhance interactivity, particularly in detecting user input and triggering animations based on those interactions.

**Key Technologies:**
HTML5: Provides the structure and semantic markup for the login page.
CSS: Drives the visual aesthetics and animations, creating an engaging user interface.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the login page, allowing for dynamic responses to user input.
